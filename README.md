PiggyBank is a college budget tracker web application that lets students keep track of important school expenses such as (books/supplies, rent, food, etc.). Our goal for our project is to create an application that is modern, user-friendly, and efficient for students looking for ways to manage their finances and save on costs. Our web application will execute CRUD operations such as adding data to the database, reading data from the database, updating, and deleting data. To distinguish our application from other products in the market, we will be following the 50/30/20 budgeting rule, which will educate students on financial literacy and will customize their budget based on long-term and short-term goals. In the 50/20/30 rule it is recommended to allocate 50% of after-tax income towards needs, 30% towards wants, and 20% towards savings and debt repayment. If the user is seen spending more on their wants, for example, they will see a modal popup window that will display a message recommending them to consider spending less on nonessential categories.
